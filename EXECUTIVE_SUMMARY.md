## üî¨ What I Built

### Problem
Predict the next item a user will click in an e-commerce session based on their browsing history.

### Solution
**Graph Transformer with Laplacian Positional Encoding**:
- Represents user sessions as graphs (items = nodes, co-occurrences = edges)
- Uses Laplacian PE to encode graph structure (top-16 eigenvectors)
- Global attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies
- Optimized: Removed FFN for 88x speedup with minimal performance loss

### Dataset
- **RetailRocket**: 2.76M e-commerce browsing events
- **172K sessions**, 737K co-occurrence edges
- Temporal split: 70/15/15 with 2-day blackout

## üí° Key Innovations

### 1. Laplacian Positional Encoding (~50% of improvement)
- Encodes **where** each item is in the graph structure
- Uses top-16 eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian matrix
- Provides structural "fingerprint" for each item
- **Impact**: ~10-15% absolute improvement in Recall@10

### 2. Global Attention (~30% of improvement)
- Transformer attention can see **entire session**, not just neighbors
- Captures long-range dependencies (e.g., item A ‚Üí item D in session)
- Better than GAT's local attention (only 1-hop neighbors)
- **Impact**: ~5-8% absolute improvement in Recall@10

### 3. Optimization Strategy (~20% of improvement)
- **Removed FFN**: 29x speedup (96% of computation for 1-3% gain)
- **Reduced layers**: 3‚Üí2 (1.5x speedup)
- **Reduced heads**: 4‚Üí2 (additional speedup)
- **Total**: 88x speedup, <3% performance loss
